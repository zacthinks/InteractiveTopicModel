This is useful because we can at any point ask ITM to make a new guess about what topic a given document should fall under given the most recent representations. There are also different scoring modes; more on this in the documentation (which should be out soon 🤞🏻), but for now, think `mode='neighbors'` as finding out what topic a document fits under based on the documents closest to it, `mode='tfidf'` for scoring based on having similar words, `mode='embeddings'` for scoring based on having similar meaning (as determined by the embedder), and `mode='harmonic'` as the harmonic mean of the previous two.\n",
