There are also different scoring modes; more on this in the documentation (which should be out soon 🤞🏻), but for now, think `mode='tfidf'` for scoring based on having similar words, `mode='embeddings'` in terms of similar meaning (as determined by the embedder), and `mode='harmonic'` as the harmonic mean of the previous two."
